This is a web app that allows you to make a complete CRUD over PROVINCIAS (yes, the hole app is in spanish) and create a NEW USER if you want to do it, and
login with it.
It was a final proyect during the FULL STACK with JAVA course in Codo a Codo program from Argentina using Eclipse IDE.
Unfortunately I can not deploy this for free.

To try it, you need to have installed the Eclipse IDE, make a new Maven proyect using the archetypes for web and confugure the Tomcat server.
Once you do this, replace the MAIN folder from this repository with the one in the proyect.
After this, you have to import the DB that I provide you, called CACPROYECTO.

And if you are using XAMPP to simulate the connection to a server, the DB file is configured to work with the port 3307 (default usually is 3306).

Finally you are going to be able to run the index.jsp file.

That is all.
